<h3>To solve this problem, I have used Tensorflow/Keras. The Python notebook contains topics such as - Data preprocessing, Creating an ANN using some neurons per layer. Later, performed Hyper parameter tuning to get exact number of layers and neurons in them. After training the model, deployed it using Flask.</h3>
